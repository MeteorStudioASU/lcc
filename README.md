# lcc
Developed by Robert LiKamWa (@roblkw_asu) and Matthew Lane (@mattlane66), with guidance from Ralph Glasgal (https://www.ambiophonics.org/). 

LCC (localized cue correction) is a solution for spatialized audio through stereo speakers.
LCC is a lightweight implementation of crosstalk cancellation so your left ear hears the left channel of audio, and your right ear hears the right channel of audio.
This is our open source version of LCC.

LCC works with symmetric head placement with respect to the speakers (that is, the speakers should be placed symmetrically in front of the user). We are in the midst of fine-tuning a solution for crosstalk cancellation with arbitrary head placement.

These instructions are for macOS or OS X.

## Setup

1. Install virtual audio device you can route audio inputs and outputs (e.g., https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases/ found in the assists sections).

2. In your Apple System Preferences for Sound, set your desired speakers to play at a comfortably loud volume. You can further adjust the system volume later with your virtual audio device / Soundflower.

3. In the Apple System Preferences, select the virtual audio device (Soundflower) as your default audio output device. 

## Running lcc 

1. Double-click on `lcc_app` to run it. You may have to right-click it and open it in order to grant permissions to run the application.

2. When lcc_app asks you to `Select input device:`, type the numerical input value for your new audio device and press enter. If you're using Soundflower, this will read `ingalls for Cycling â€™74: Soundflower (2ch)`)

3. When lcc_app asks you to `Select output device:`, type the numerical value for the desired speakers. (For example, `Apple Inc.: Built-in Output` for your Macbook's internal speakers.)

4. Set your preferred sample rate, e.g., 44100.

5. Press 1 and then enter to turn on LCC. Press 2 and then enter to turn off LCC.

6. See below for advanced parameter tuning.

## Compiling code
To compile the code on a Mac, navigate to the directory, open the Terminal, and run:
```
g++ -lpthread -framework CoreAudio -Wall -D__MACOSX_CORE__ -framework CoreFoundation lcc_buffer_rtaudio.cpp RtAudio.cpp  -lm -o lcc;
```

## Advanced parameter tuning
(Coming soon)
